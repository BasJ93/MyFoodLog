Technical Story: Select a front end design package

## Context and Problem Statement

Since I'm a backend dev, I want to make building my frontend easy. Therefore I want to use an exisiting design package that provides me CSS.

## Considered Options

- Boostrap
- Material Design

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Material Design", because I like the look and feel of Android which also uses Material. It also helps a nice library for Blazor is available.
