## Context and Problem Statement

What are the best names for the different views in the application? Working titles are useful, be should be replaced with better/proper names in the end. This ADR will state the first name to use for a view.

## Decision Drivers

- The title of a view should clearly convey the purpose of a view.
- Terminology established in different apps should be kept.
- Terminology used in related fields (i.e. food science, dietetics, etc.) should be use if it is in common use.

## Decision Outcome

The page showing an overview of the consumed foods in meals on a day will be called `diary` as this clearly conveys it's use, and is use in the same manner in other calorie tracking apps.
