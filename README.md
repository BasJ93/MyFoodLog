# MyFoodLog
MyFoodLog is a self-hosted calorie tracking app that integrates with Grocy, OpenFoodFacts, and Spoonacular to provide users with a comprehensive tool to monitor their daily caloric intake, macronutrients, and micronutrients intake.
Users can use MyFoodLog to input their meals and snacks and track the nutritional information, such as calories, protein, fat, and carbohydrates by pulling the data from the integrated databases. Additionally, they can also use the recipe calculator feature to plan meals using the recipes from Spoonacular and track the nutritional information of the meals.
The app also includes features such as a barcode scanner and a recipe calculator, so users can quickly scan packaged foods and see their nutritional information, as well as input recipes and track the nutritional information of those recipes.
It also integrates with Grocy to give users access to their recipe and meal plan data, as well as their home inventory and shopping list. This allows users to plan their meals based on what ingredients they already have at home, and also create a shopping list of the items they need to purchase. It allows the user to be more organized and efficient with their food consumption and also make a use of available ingredients to reduce food waste.
